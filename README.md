# Blazor Ramp … in progress …

Blazor Ramp aims to provide a suite of modular, accessible-first Blazor components, delivered individually via NuGet.

Please check back **regularly** during this **initial** phase whilst I put in place everything you would expect.

Whilst you are waiting, please visit the test site [blazorramp.uk](https://blazorramp.uk)
 and use any **assistive** technology at your disposal to help identify any issues with the **Live Region Service**, **Announcement history** and **Busy Indicator** components under test.

Thank you for **your** patience,

Paul

**P.S** I need a logo and icon for the NuGet packages if you have a spare one
