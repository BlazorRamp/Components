# Blazor Ramp … in progress …

Please check back **regularly** during this **initial** phase whilst I put in place everything you would expect.

Whilst you are waiting, please visit the test site <a href="https://blazorramp.uk" target="_blank">blazorramp.uk (opens in new window)</a>
 and use any **assistive** technology at your disposal to help identify any issues with the components under test.

Thank you for **your** patience,

Paul

**P.S** I need a logo and icon for the NuGet packages if you have a spare one
